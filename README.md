## Paul's Make Change Homework Project

This is my week 1 project.

This is a change machine that receives 2 inputs from the user. One is the cost of an item and the other is the tender amount received from the customer. If the cost of the item exceeds the amount received by the customer, an error message will appear and the program will prompt the user for new values. If the cost of the item equals the amount received by the customer, a message stating that "no change is due" will appear. Upon entering amounts where change is due, the program will compute the exact number of bills and coins needed to give change to the customer. The denominations are ten, five and one dollar bills and the coins includes quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies.
