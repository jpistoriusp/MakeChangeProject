## Paul's Make Change Homework Project

This is my week 1 project.

This is a change machine that receives 2 inputs from the user. One is the cost of an item and the other is tender amount received by the customer. If the cost of the item exceeds the amount received by the customer, an error message will appear and the program will prompt the user for new values. If the cost of the item equals the amount received by the customer, a message stating that no change is due will appear. Upon entering commands where change is due, the program will compute the exact number of bills and coins needed to give change to the customer. The denominations range from ten dollar bills to one dollar bills and the change includes quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies.
